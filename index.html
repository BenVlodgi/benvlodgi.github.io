		<p>Hello World! I'm Benjamin Thomas Blodgett, a human.</p>
		
		<p>I greatly enjoy playing and creating games; most notably, puzzle games.
		   The first game I started designing levels for, was <a href="https://supertux.github.io/download.html">SuperTux</a> for my brothers and sisters at home.<br />
		   I started programming on my TI-84 when I was 14, and took my first programming class when I was 17.
		   I moved on to creating and <a href="https://www.thesimsresource.com/members/bensworld99">sharing</a> custom content for The Sims.<br />
		   After playing Valve's Portal, I fell in love with puzzle games, and picked up Valve's SDK and began creating content of my own.
		   Years later now, I have now have many friends in the Source Community, and am part of many different projects.
		</p>
	        <p>In 2019, I began working for <a href="https://deathball.net/supragames/">Supra Games</a> on new Supraland content. It has been a great time, and I've learned so much about <i>fun</i> in the process. In my spare time I've been working on my own puzzle game currently titled Daakorun.
		   I love that I get to work full time on creating fun game content that players really connect with.
		</p>
	      	<p>On a personal note, I'm married to a lovely woman, and we are parents to fraternal twins. I've entered a new realm of sleep deprivation :)
		</p>
		<p>Want to get in contact with me, my email is at the top!</p>
