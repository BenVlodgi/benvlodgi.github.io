        <p>Hello World! I am Benjamin Thomas Blodgett, a human.</p>
        <p>I greatly enjoy playing and creating games; most notably: puzzle games.
          The first game I levels I designed were for <a href="https://supertux.github.io/download.html">SuperTux</a> for my brothers and sisters at home.<br />
          I started programming on my TI-84 when I was 14, and took my first programming class when I was 17.
          I moved on to creating and <a href="https://www.thesimsresource.com/members/bensworld99">sharing</a> custom content for The Sims.<br />
          After playing Valve's Portal, I fell in love with puzzle games, and picked up Valve's SDK and began creating content of my own.
          Years later now, I have now have many friends in the Source Community, and am part of many different projects.
        </p>
        <p>In 2019, I began working for <a href="https://deathball.net/supragames/">Supra Games</a> on new Supraland content. We shipped <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1522870/Supraland_Six_Inches_Under/">Supraland Six Inches Under</a> in 2022, which was my first shipped game. It has been a great time, and I've learned so much about <i>fun</i> in the process. In my spare time I've been working on my own puzzle game currently titled Daakorun.
          I love that I get to work full time on creating fun game content that players really connect with.
        </p>
        <p>On a personal note, I am married to a lovely woman, and we are parents to fraternal twins plus one. I've entered a new realm of sleep deprivation :)
